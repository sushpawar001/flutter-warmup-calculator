# Warm up Calculator

This application is designed to calculate your warm-up sets leading up to your main set. It is particularly useful for the first lift of the day, often compound exercises such as squats, bench presses, or deadlifts. The app includes options to input the available plate weights and the bar weight. 

Please note that the available plates are categorized by weight, not quantity. The app functions with any weight unit. To use weights in pounds, simply enter the bar weight and available plate weights in pounds.

## Calculation Methods

1. **Heaviest First:** This method selects the heaviest available plate first.
2. **Equal Jumps:** This method aims to achieve an equal weight increase for each set. If equal increments are not possible, the Heaviest First method will be applied.
